# FeedMeUp

Simple food ordering app

I created this app to practice the basic mechanisms and beginner hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef) in React.

Working features:

- Possibility to add four different meals to cart
- Displaying the modal of the selected meal
- Dynamic shopping cart
- Customizable number of meals from the meal modal and cart level
